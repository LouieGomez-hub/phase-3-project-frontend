            <p>What is Made Super? The simple answer is this a web page full of fake generated superheroes. However, what this web application really is, is a starting point for creation. For anyone interested in superheroes, powers/abilities or anyone who just has an idea that needs a way to be expressed, this is what Made Super is all about. This app gives you the freedom to create a powered being that is your very own, assign a name and power(s) to your character and you've now layed the groundwork for something you can do anything with. Whether you're just having a bit of creative fun or giving life to an old idea you've been waiting to get to, Made Super is Made For You By You.</p>
